# The Code Cup

A Jetpack Compose Android app for a fictional coffee shop. Users can browse drinks, view details, customize options, add items to cart, and checkout.

## Tech stack
- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose + Material 3
- Navigation Compose
- Simple in-memory data manager for menu and cart state

## Screens
- Splash
- Home (menu grid, loyalty card)
- Details (customize shot, size, ice)
- Cart (edit/remove, total price)

## Build & run
1. Open the project in Android Studio (Giraffe+).
2. Connect a device/emulator running Android 8.0+.
3. Click **Run**. Compose preview works for UI iteration.

## Notes
- Light theme palette follows provided Figma (blue CTAs, dark card panels, coffee accent).
- No backend; data resets when the app restarts.
